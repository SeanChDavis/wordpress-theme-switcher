# Theme Switcher

_This WordPress plugin is not intended for use on production sites. It is intended for use on development sites only._

## Description

WordPress plugin that allows you to switch themes from the front-end of your site.

**Once installed and activated, this plugin will add a "Switch Theme" link to the admin bar.**

Hovering over this link will display a list of themes that are installed on your site. Clicking on a theme will switch your site to that theme.

### Notes

* No preview is provided. If you click a theme name, it will switch your site to that theme immediately.
* The admin bar link will not appear in the admin area. Only the front end.
